The Surface object is used to make the level geometry.

The Surface object is a Draggable object. You have to Drag and Release to create one.
Hold Alt while dragging to change the height of the Surface object.

If you are unhappy that the surface object turned out slightly different from your liking, or you want to make more complex shapes, you can go into Vertex Mode (read "Editor Modes") to edit the vertices of the selected Surface obejct.

Materials panel:
The Materials panel is on the right side of the screen.
Selecting one of the Materials while not having an existing Surface object selected will change the material of the next surface obejct that you'll place.
Selecting one of the Materials while having an existing Surface object selected will change the material of that surface object.

The Random Material:
The Random Material is used for giving surfaces randomly generated textures.
The Random Textures are generated when playing the level.

Variables:
If you're familiar with game engines or modeling software, you should already know what these do.
UV_SCALE: Used to scale the texture.
TRIPLANAR: Used to lock the texture to the global coordinates.
UV_OFFSET: Used to offset the texture.
UV_SCALE and UV_OFFSET might not work when TRIPLANAR is on.
