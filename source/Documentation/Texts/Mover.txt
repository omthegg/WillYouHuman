A Mover can move objects based on the numbers you give it.
You must first put the desired objects into a group and put the name of said group into the "move_group" variable of the Mover.
Movers can be triggered by Buttons.

Variables:
move_group: The name of the group of objects that you want to move.
move_vector.x: The distance the objects will move on the X axis.
move_vector.y: The distance the objects will move on the Y axis.
move_vector.z: The distance the objects will move on the Z axis.
time: The time the Mover will take to move the objects.

You can see a preview of the location of objects after they get moved.
