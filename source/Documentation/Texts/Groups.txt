You can put objects in groups on the left side of the screen in the Variables tab.
Groups can be used for triggering objects and specifying which objects belong to which difficulty levels.
Groups don't need to be created first. You just have to add the name of the group in the groups list in the Variables tab.
You can remove an object from a group by hitting the X button next to the group name.
Do not remove the object from the default groups.
